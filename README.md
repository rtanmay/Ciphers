# Ciphers
This repository contains algorithms that encrypts plain text into cipher text using the following algorithms:

  1)Caesar Cipher

  2)Substitution cipher
  
  3)Vigener cipher

User has the option to choose the type of algorithm for encryption.

KEY

The user is provided with the option to input they key or choose the random key.
The program will also return the key(if key chosen is random) along the cipher text for decryption.
